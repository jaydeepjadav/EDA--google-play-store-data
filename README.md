## INTRODUCTIONS

### Problem statement

Main Libraries to be used

Pandas for data manipulation, age egation
Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualisation and behaviour with respect to the target variable.
NumPy for computationally efficient operations


### BUSINESS OBJECTIVE-

Google Play Store is most renowned and preferred software for the application market. If one has the idea to invest in the application market of Play Store he should be going through some research or survey in order to get more information about the market. As everyone starts business in order to be more successful and for that it has to go through data analysis.

So that company get the idea or plan into which direction they should be heading that is which type of application to built in order to get promising growth, for that I have made this project on play store app analysis. In this project I have majorly focused on which type of category to choose for the application, so mainly my business objective is to help selecting perfect category for the application.

I choose this objective of selecting category because I consider it as most crucial part for the company because on the basis of category they can focus on specific audience majorly which will provide boost to business. Because selecting perfect category is equivalent to establishing fundamental principle of the application on which the customer will get attracted to.


### DATASET INFORMATION

I have made project on play store data which helps in deciding the kind of application to makeon the basis of pre-stored data, if a person wants to invest or starts his/her business in application market this project will mainly helps in selecting the category for the application. Here are the link to datasets which were used 
1) dataset 1 :- https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pVZNhpwbqbu3xLf6J-1KrQI_-B8KqDCt/view
2) dataset 2 :- https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zJmyrNtkv_ZnVAY1wtg1irTRbpoZ9rRH/view

### Graphs:-

1) From below charts it can easily be identify that which categories of apps are mostly used by users. There are two charts to know the customer behaviour, first chart shows the average no. of installations made as per Category and second one shows most no. of installs made my specific category. As you can see in charts average and the most installed app rankings are different that is in terms of average no. installs of a 'communication' is higher but in the most installed app category it is the 'game' category, we can conclude from that some categories with more no. of installs can be due to few high demanding apps while other apps of same category could be struggling for installs, and for avg. no of installed Category chart shows that which Category have reliable no. of customer engagement.

2) As size is one of th factor which is kept as small as possible so that it occupies less space in memory, And it also important to keep in note that depending on the category size app is kept for better business i.e. customer won't install application if they have compromise on large memory space for just weather application. So it is important to keep apps size as small as possible.

From this area chart we can easily say most apps are of conent rating 'everyone' while other ratings are comparatively very low for both types of app whether free or paid. insight can be that restricting the content rating of the app to a specific age group of people can result in low installs as the target audiance will be limited. So content of application should be appropriate to all age group.

SENTIMENT ANALYSIS OF USERS.

Below two charts shows the user sentiments and behaviour...

Sentiment to sentiment polarity chart shows whether users have positive, negative or neutral sentiments. Polarity is a float value within the range [-1.0 to 1.0] where 0 indicates neutral, +1 indicates a very positive sentiment and -1 represents a very negative sentiment.

Sentiments to sentiment subjectivty chart shows whether the reviews given by the users is more subjective or objective, subjectivity is a float value within the range [0.0 to 1.0] where 0.0 is very objective and 1.0 is very subjective. Subjective sentence expresses some personal feelings, views, beliefs, opinions, allegations, desires, beliefs, suspicions, and speculations where as Objective sentences are factual.
